Password Manager Application

This is a secure password manager application that allows you to store and manage your passwords in an encrypted and protected manner. The application employs robust security measures to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of your sensitive data.

Security Features
Zero-Knowledge Encryption
The application utilizes zero-knowledge encryption, which means that your master password and sensitive data are known only to you. Here's how the zero-knowledge encryption works:

Your master password is transformed into an encryption key using industry-standard algorithms, including encryption, hashing with salting, and secure hashes.
The encryption key is used to encrypt and decrypt your vault where your passwords are stored.
The encryption and decryption processes occur locally on your device, ensuring that your unencrypted data remains separated from the server.
Encryption Algorithm
The application employs 256-bit AES encryption/decryption algorithm, which is an industry-standard symmetric encryption algorithm known for its robustness and security.

Password Hashing
To protect your master password, the application uses the PBKDF2 derivation function with a secure hash (SHA256) and salting. This adds an additional layer of security to prevent unauthorized access to your master password.

Secure Communication
All communication between the client and server is secured using SSL/TLS encryption, ensuring that your data is transmitted over a secure channel.

Privacy and Data Protection
Your privacy and data protection are of utmost importance. Here's how we ensure the privacy and security of your data:

Your encrypted passwords and other sensitive information are securely stored on our servers.
We adhere to strict data protection practices and comply with applicable privacy laws and regulations.
We do not have access to your master password or unencrypted data, ensuring that only you have control over your passwords.
Usage
Sign up for an account by providing a valid email address and a strong master password.
Log in using your credentials to securely access your password vault.
Add, edit, and delete passwords as needed. Your passwords are encrypted and protected using the highest security standards.
Your passwords are decrypted locally on your device when needed, ensuring maximum security.
