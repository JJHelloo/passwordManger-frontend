Password Manager Application

This is a secure password manager application that allows you to store and manage your passwords in an encrypted and protected manner. The application employs robust security measures to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of your sensitive data.

Security Features
Zero-Knowledge Encryption
The application utilizes zero-knowledge encryption, which means that your master password and sensitive data are known only to you. Here's how the zero-knowledge encryption works:

Your master password is transformed into an encryption key using industry-standard algorithms, including encryption, hashing with salting, and secure hashes.
The encryption key is used to encrypt and decrypt your vault where your passwords are stored.
The encryption and decryption processes for all your passowrds occur locally on your device, ensuring that your unencrypted data remains separated from the server, and do not travel unencrypted.
Encryption Algorithm
The application employs PBKDF2 along with 256-bit AES encryption/decryption algorithm, which is an industry-standard symmetric encryption algorithm known for its robustness and security.

Password Hashing
To protect your master password, the application utilizes the bcrypt password-hashing function, which incorporates salt and multiple rounds of hashing. This one-way hashing function ensures that the original master password cannot be easily retrieved from the stored hash. Bcrypt is widely recognized for its strong security characteristics and is commonly used to securely store passwords in various applications.
By using bcrypt, your master password is transformed into a irreversible hash, making it extremely difficult for unauthorized individuals to reverse-engineer or obtain the original password from the stored hash. This adds an additional layer of security to protect your master password and prevent unauthorized access to your sensitive data.
Please note that the use of a one-way hashing function like bcrypt is considered a best practice for password security in applications.

Privacy and Data Protection
Your privacy and data protection are of utmost importance. Here's how we ensure the privacy and security of your data:

Your encrypted passwords and other sensitive information are securely stored on our servers.
We do not have access to your master password or unencrypted data, ensuring that only you have control over your passwords.
Usage
Sign up for an account by providing a valid email address and a strong master password.
Log in using your credentials to securely access your password vault.
Your passwords are decrypted locally on your device when needed, ensuring maximum security.
